## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: React + TailwindCSS + Zustand + TanStack Query + shadcn/ui
* **Backend**: Node.js + Express + JWT + MongoDB + Redis
* **Sockets**: Socket.IO (chat & room collaboration)
* **Execution Engine**:

  * Languages supported: C++, Java, Python
  * Runs inside Docker
  * Async execution with polling
* **Other Tools**: Redis (for job queues and result storage), BullMQ (for job processing)

## üìë Features

### ‚úÖ General

## üîê Secure User Authentication

Our application implements a robust and secure authentication mechanism combining JWTs and sessions for optimal protection.

### ‚úÖ Features

- **JWT + Session-Based Authentication**  
  Combines stateless JWTs with server-side sessions to provide both scalability and control.

- **Token Rotation**  
  Refresh tokens are rotated with each request, minimizing the risk of long-lived token abuse.

- **Device-Level Validation**  
  Each token is tied to a hashed browser fingerprint to ensure it's used only on the issuing device.

- **Redis-Backed Token Storage**  
  Access and refresh tokens are stored securely as hashed entries in Redis for fast invalidation and tracking.

- **Global Logout with OTP Verification**  
  Users can securely log out from all active devices using a verified OTP flow.

This architecture ensures both usability and strong session security across all entry points.

* Survey system with role-based users (Admin, Business, User)

### üñãÔ∏è Collaborative Editor

* Real-time code sync across clients
* Supports multiple languages (C++, Python, Java)
* Output & Input area below editor
* Run button executes via microservice
* Invite friends to a room
