## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: React + TailwindCSS + Zustand + TanStack Query + shadcn/ui
* **Backend**: Node.js + Express + JWT + MongoDB + Redis
* **Sockets**: Socket.IO (chat & room collaboration)
* **Execution Engine**:

  * Languages supported: C++, Java, Python
  * Runs inside Docker
  * Async execution with polling
* **Other Tools**: Redis (for job queues and result storage), BullMQ (for job processing)

## üìë Features

### ‚úÖ General

* User Auth ((JWT+Session)-based) implemented token rotation and validated them against the browser fingerprint and hashed redis entries for more security . log out from all devices supported via otp based verification 
* Survey system with role-based users (Admin, Business, User)

### üñãÔ∏è Collaborative Editor

* Real-time code sync across clients
* Supports multiple languages (C++, Python, Java)
* Output & Input area below editor
* Run button executes via microservice
* Invite friends to a room
* Will support cursor sharing

### üîå Socket Features

* Chat server on `:5000`
* Room collaboration socket on `:5001`
* Cursor tracking (planned)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Running Locally

### Prerequisites

* Docker
* Node.js
* Redis

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/collab-editor
cd collab-editor

# Install dependencies
cd backend && npm install
cd ../frontend && npm install
cd ../code-executor && npm install

# Start redis manually or with Docker
redis-server
